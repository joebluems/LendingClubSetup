Not only would this loan lower the interest, it also sets an end date. My church just finished a series of teachings called Crash Course in which we discussed the importance of having more margin in our lives, including time, morality and money. This can be found at TCABC.com under the teachings page if interested. The teaching on money margin really hit home, as my wife and I have made more money we have spent more money, like most Americans. We have gotten involved with Financial Peace University and started using Mint.com to help us achieve our goal of getting out of debt in 3 to 4 years. We have both been blessed to work for almost 10 years with companies that have shown steady growth even over the last 2 years instead of suffering from the economic downturn. I manage the recruiting for a division of one of the premier convenience store chains that has more new stores in development than it has in 20 years. We are doing very well. My wife is one the most popular pet groomers in the city, she has steady appointments booked for 2 to 3 months and has only seen growth each year despite the economy. We are extremely lucky to have great job security in these economic times.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Consolidation,740xx,OK,13.38,0.0,Nov-1992,0.0,,,13.0,0.0,10298,32.7,35.0,f,0

She is in her last semester. The house has lost all of the equity I had in it due to the housing market changes. With the increases in credit card rates I can see the interest rates trending higher and higher. I would like to be able to pay off this fixed amount of debt in 3 years. Doing this will decrease my monthly payment amounts and also allow me to get back on track. I am a very reliable person and have never defaulted on any debt in my entire life. I have a secure job (working for my present employer for the past 9+ years) and have been self reliant my entire adult life. Once my daughter is finished with school, I will no longer have her living expenses which will currently are about $1,000 a month. I currently  have about $40,000 in a 401K account but I would like to leave it there if at all possible. Thank you for your consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 01/27/10 > My current outgoing expenses paid now including mortgage, car, insurance, utilities, food and credit card debt is approximately $6,400 My take home pay is around $7,000. I can make the minimum plus on all cards currently but the payments are increasing along with the interest rates.  Using this $25,000 will consolidate all credit cards except one lowering my outgoing expenses to $6,000 (saving $400+) but most importantly giving me a end date.  Starting in July I will no longer have the college expenses of my daughter (around $1,000/month). This will allow me to use this $1,000 towards the one remaining $18,000 credit card and be able to be credit card debt free within 3 years.  I accrued this credit card debt because of college expenses/tuiton for my son who already graduated and daughter (currently in her last year).  I have about $3,500 in savings currently but would like to keep it there if possible.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation Help Needed,957xx,CA,16.35,0.0,Jun-1994,2.0,48.0,,18.0,0.0,38416,59.4,37.0,f,0

The hobby we enjoy most in our lives is to go camping with our three horses and three dogs.  We love nature and spending time with our animals.  We are very responsible when it comes to taking care of our environment and so would only be using our truck for towing our trailer and hauling large items in it's bed.  The only reason we need such a large one ton, 4 door truck is for its towing capability in pulling such a large trailer and for it's cab space to bring along our dogs, friends, and family to share in the fun and relaxation.  We love the idea of buying from a private party so as to help them out at the same time as they help us save money by not going through a dealership.  This is the same reason we would like to go through lending club.  I would always prefer to have an individual make money off of my loan rather than an impersonal bank.  As for our financial responsibility,  we are very reliable in paying off our debt.  After a rocky start to our relationship about 8 years ago, we have taken great care and pride in our credit and financial situation.  We have NEVER been late on a payment!!  We would greatly appreciate the opportunity to do business with you.  Thank you for considering us for your lending network.

And the Lowes and Best Buy are very far off from the pay off dates, and will be paid off in the same manner (using the ""extra"" check that is before the due dates).

It was already an older pool with collapsable piping and chipping plaster, but now it is real bad.  We are loosing water at one end where the it is down to the gunite and now the skimmer pipe has collasped, so we need to get repaired ASAP. My wife is a nurse and her job is very stable and my job is stable. We have good credit, as a matter a fact, this loan information does not reflect my wife's income.  That is the other reason I need this loan to fix the pool, so my wife will stop nagging.(Ha')  Seriously, it is very important that we make this improvement as the weather here in Houston is fixin to get hot and humid and we don't want algae and green slim in our water.  Thank you.  The only payment besides our everyday living expenses is our house payment and we haven't been in the home long. We love it and want to repair things the right way as they come up, unfortunately anything pertaining to the pool is expensive, but they tell us that once we do this, it will be good to go for 15-20 years if we take of it the right way.

The credit cards we are consolidating are in our personal name but were used for business purposes so our business had been paying the monthly payments.  The credit cards are:  Citibank $17,000 APR 29.9% (we will be paying off $10,000 of this next week and the balance consolidated); Capital One $17,000 APR 29.4% (this will be consolidated).  Other debts include Capital One $18,000 APR 15.9%, which the business will continue to pay, Sears $1,500 will be paid off next month by the business and First Community $5,000, which will be paid off in September by the business.  The business is construction related so due to several hurricanes and the state of the housing market the credit card debt crept up since we had to continue paying normal operating expenses.  The market is coming back and the business is busy again.  Even in slow times we were still able to make the minimun payments on the debt but obviously not getting anywhere as far as paying it off.  If we are able to consolidate the debt we will make some headway on paying it off at a much lower interest rate.<br/>",credit_card,Credit Card Re-finance and Consolidation Loan,339xx,FL,22.03,1.0,Dec-1992,0.0,4.0,,22.0,0.0,11506,19.3,46.0,f,0

I do have health insurance but it's not covering a large percentage of the bills that I have to pay. None of these health problems are ongoing. (They are things like an emergency removal of painful wisdom teeth which cost several thousand dollars.) However, two things have occurred. First, I am having trouble paying the bills without entirely depleting my savings. And second, because of the recovery time for my conditions, I've been working less which has reduced my income.  I do have the credit cards necessary to make these payments if needed but was hoping to get a better rate on a private loan since my credit card interest rates are high.

I live with my husband (who also has a stable job) and 2 beautiful children in Illinois. We are both hardworking parents and have been putting money aside specifically for a new bathroom for over a year. My husband recent left the State for some contract work and given the economy and the freezing of our home equity credit line we are unwilling to use cash that we have in our savings account to finance a new bathroom. We've read extensively about P2P lending and feel it is well worth a shot especially with the state the credit market is in right now. Why not put this off until I can get my home equity 'unfrozen'? Well, I do not know how long this mess will last to be honest. As far as repayment is concerned, I am going to pay this loan off in no longer than a year and a half. I would rather raise my 401(k) contribution than use the extra cash flow to pay off interest.

I withdrew most of the funds from my brokerage account 3 years ago to pay off a credit card, and to assist a friend in getting rid of some of her inefficient debt a well.  I have since been recompensed over time (charged her no interest).  My mortgage debt is structured very efficiently.  5.0% fixed 30 year mortgage, 5.24% (prime minus 1.26% variable) HELOC.  I traded profitably for 3 years, and never blew up my account.  Only one of my 3 years showed a net loss (very small one at that) and the other two showed moderate profits.  The technicals -------------------- - My credit score, according to Transunion (Dec 8, 2007) is 784.  - I have a home - Bank owns 80%, I own 20% in equity so far, and I'm gaining on them!  Unlike some poor folks who are now upside down in their mortgages I bought in 2002 and have seen handsome appreciation in my area, despite sub-prime crisis.  I've felt the effects but its not as pronounced here. - I am 37, professional software engineer at a Chicago software company - I traded part time for 3 years, and intend to continue this endeavor once I am fully capitalized again.   - I do not trade derivatives at this time (futures/options).  I trade strictly in equities at this time, and don't plan on using derivaties at this time.  I think futures, especially, are too risky for a part-timer, or even an under-prepared full-timer, so I'm staying completely away from them for the forseeable future. - Net assets (including 401K which is considered a non-liquid asset due to taxation on it) is about $130,000.  And thats a conservative estimate.  My 401K comprises about $110,000 of that. - My monthly take-home from salary is about $4800 - I have one credit card with a balance on it, much of that debt is 0%, and almost half carries a 9.9% rate.  - I am an INTj  Any questions, feel free to ask.  I'm not sure how this works but I assume there is a way to connect lenders and borrowers for further dialogue.  -dcbinkowski",small_business,37 year old INTJ seeks cheap capital,601xx,IL,12.0,0.0,Oct-1991,3.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,90335,53.5,36.0,f,0

I will limit most personal information due to privacy concerns.  I know this is social lending but I would think most people would limit themselves to the information that is needed during a normal bank loan application. 557443 added on 10/16/09 > CREDIT HISTORY: ----------------- 01/06/2009  FICO Scores:  TransUnion: 751 Equifax: 737 Experian: 749   04/08/2009  FICO Scores:  TransUnion: 756 Equifax: 737  FAKO Score: Experian PLUS: 767   06/29/2009  TransUnion: 741 Equifax: 736  FAKO Score: Experian PLUS: 748   * The reason behind the lower scores in June was because the first of May I bought an addition vehicle because the ONE vehicle we had was too small for my family.  We had been driving ONE small vehicle for the last 3 years which has been paid off for the last 7 years (wife side).   I sold mine because it was a 2 seater sports card. :( 557443 added on 10/16/09 > OCCUPATION: ------------  It states where I work and the state I live in. I will not state my job title or official description because you could easily identify me with information via Google or by calling my employer. I will state vaguely that I work supporting computer systems. 557443 added on 10/16/09 > BUDGET: ------------  My annual salary is $61,200. I get paid biweekly. My logic is that I make $4,707 a month calculating for 2 biweekly paychecks not 2 and 1/12th biweekly paychecks.  My mortgage payment is $748.71 but I've been paying over and ahead to keep a cushion. Every two weeks at the beginning of each year I pay the mortgage, so by the time the month of August rolls around I'm a month ahead because of biweekly paychecks.  I pay $850.10 a month on my mortgage. That is $784.71 divided by 12 plus $748.71. $784.71 / 12 = $65.39 + $784.71 = $850.10 So I can make 13 equivalent payments a year with only paying 12 and it is less interest in the long run this way.   I pay $380 a month for the auto loan and interest on that loan is 4.25%. I don't pay extra on the auto loan because the interest paid is so low compared to the interest paid on my mortgage. Because I can save more money by paying extra towards the mortgage and not the auto loan.   Monthly Income : $4,707  Mortgage : $784.71 (but have been paying $850.10 from the beginning so lets use this number for DTI) Auto Loan : $380   DTI Ratio : 26.00%   Credit Card Debit: $250 (this is a comfortable payment, so yes I will be paying extra on this loan)  DTI with this loan: 30.06%  * I don't find it necessary to post my grocery, utility, or other ""bills"" that are not credit related. 557443 added on 10/16/09 > SAVINGS: --------- As of 10/16/2009 I have a total of $21,300 across 3 retirement accounts.  I save 5% of my paycheck for my 401(k).  I stopped a year ago on my Roth and IRA due to the market meltdown (it sucked to see your money vanish the day after you put it in). We had a $2,000 emergency savings fund until a month ago where a family emergency had hit but did not involve my household family members.

But in the meantime, I dig my head into anything that makes money. Right now I'm working on a deal for importing Russian preserves, including jams, pickles and other canned goods; the only thing that is holding me back is the fact that I don't have the needed resources for me to deal a large and longer terms contract with these people. Thats the purpose of this loan to get the right location, resources where I can manage, distribute and handle similar deals.  Ive knocked other banks for this business loan, but all of them are looking for minimum of 3 years of business history in order for them even to consider for a small business loan.

I have been struggling with debt for the past 6 years.  I graduated from college with a degree in accounting in May of 2005.  Although my wonderful father paid for my tuition through school, I was living on my own all through school and depended on a part-time job and credit cards to pay for rent, groceries, gas, etc.   After I graduated, I was lucky enough to find my dream job rather quickly.  A junior accountant at a small,local CPA firm.  I have been there for 2 years now and have since been promoted to a senior.  Since getting this new job, I have gotten my debt down from 13,000 to 4,500.  I have contacted all the credit card companies asking for lower rates, but they say I cant have one because of the missed payments from years ago.  I feel so overwhelmed sometimes, I cant sleep.  I have 3 different credit cards all due at different times not to mention a car payment, rent, utilities, etc.  I have asked all the credit card companies for higher limits so I could consolidate to make one payment, but again, 2-3 years ago, when I was working 20 hours a week at a grocery store and going to school full time I had late payments and overdraft charges (mostly due to the late payment fees).  I am asking for this loan so that I can finally be free of this debt, and stop it from looming over my head.  I am planning to get married this fall and we both hope to be debt free before then, so we will be able to start saving for a house.  If I am get a loan, I will be forever greatful and hope one day not far from now to be in the position to help someone else who needs a hand.

Two days after our wedding, we found out we needed a new air conditioner and a new furnace for the house.  Not exactly something  you want to hear after just spending a large amount on our wedding.<br/><br/>This set back really forced us to sit down and discuss our finances.  We both brought some debt into the marriage and feel that it is very important to start our marriage off on the right foot.  We came to Lending Club to do just that.<br/><br/>The best way for us to get off on the right foot is to consolidate all of our debt, so that ultimately in 3 years we can be completely debt free (what an amazing thought that is).<br/><br/>We both have solid full time jobs (with absolutely no threat of being laid off).  And with this loan we ultimately would like to pay it off prior to the 36 months and between both incomes, we definitely have a shot at doing that.<br/><br/>I hope that you really consider helping fund our loan.  It would be awesome to be able to start our marriage off on a happier note :)<br/><br/>Please feel free to ask us any questions, we would be more than happy to answer anything.<br/> Borrower added on 06/27/10 > Thank you for taking the time to review our loan.<br/><br/>My beautiful wife and I were married May 21st 2010.  Two days after our wedding we found out that we needed to replace not just our air conditioner in our house, but also our furnace.  Not exactly the way a couple wants to start off their marriage.<br/><br/>We understand things like this happen and it really forced us to sit down and evaluate our finances.  We both brought some debt into the marriage (nothing really significant, but enough to make us look for a plan of action).  Which is what brought us to Lending Club - we want to start our marriage off on the right foot, by consolidating our debt and being close to debt free in 3 years (we can't even imagine how awesome that would be).<br/><br/>We are asking for $22,000 which will give us the amount we need to pay off all the debt we have minus a mortgage and some student loans.<br/><br/>For us to be able to do this would be huge - rather than paying finance charges for a number of small bills, to be able to pay one bill would rock - we really would be starting our married life off right.<br/><br/>Both my wife and I have steady full time jobs (with no threat of being laid off).  She has worked at a Harley-Davidson dealership for the past 4 years as an event coordinator/marketing manager and I have worked for Norfolk Southern Railroad as a Yardmaster for the past 6+ years.<br/><br/>We understand that it is not always easy to take a chance with your money, but we would hope that you consider funding our loan.  Ultimately we would like to pay this off in less than 36 months and now with our combined income, I can definitely see that as a possibility.  Feel free to ask us any questions, we would love to give you all the information you need to make a decision.

This loan would allow me to pay off my current student loan with Sallie Mae which has an obnoxious interest rate of 12.375%! I actually owe more than I originally financed even after paying on it for 2 years! I know I deserve a better rate. I have excellent credit, in the high 760's. I'm quite proud to say so, my history is in good standing with every loan I've ever taken. Not too many people these days can say they're &quot;credible&quot; I CAN! I plan to use this loan to pay off that loan and move toward my ultimate goal of financial freedom. I make a great borrower because my monthly cost of living is so low. I don't have a car payment, I own my truck. I don't pay utilities as I rent all inclusive. I'm not married and don't have any children. <br/>I have a stereotypical hospitality job where I deal blackjack in a casino. But I'm also a licensed Esthetician (Skin Care Specialist). It's my true calling and passion. I can't pursue the genre in the spa industry that I want to without additional training. I'd like to do more advanced skin care which requires laser certifications and training for more invasive procedures such as chemical peels and dermabrasions. By receiving this loan at the low rate it is, I will be able to afford to further my career and propel myself into the aspect of the industry that most fascinates me.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>I'm always available for questions.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Pay off Sallie Mae!,890xx,NV,16.4,0.0,Apr-2004,0.0,24.0,,6.0,0.0,3278,17.7,10.0,f,0

But now I am a professional making good money, I own a condo and a car, and I am always on time with my payments.

I have over 14 years selling, building, and assembling race cars.  This is truly a passion of mine and I can't wait to grow the business. My need for these additional funds is to help with additional business startup cost.  These include logo design, website development, raw material purchases, and equipment.  I have currently invested over $75k into this business venture between the cost of the building (3000sf), tools, machinery and professional services.  Currently to date I have registered my LLC, received my EIN, begun development of my logo, registered my domain name, and consulted a tax attorney.  I recently attended a trade show to reunite with old customers to grow the business through word of mouth.  I am not seeking traditional business startup funding from other avenues since my needs are very small.  I have run a race related business entirely before and maintain a large number of contacts throughout the market to develop sales leads and promote my business.  All of this is done after hours of my current job and therefore does not cause any conflict of interest issues.    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I am current on all debts that I have.  I am never late.  I am still living within my means and taking on this additional loan will not become a burden I cannot handle.  This money is only going to help grow my business which will increase my revenue intake, therefore helping to pay this loan off ahead time.  Please ask any questions you have, and I will be prompt to answer.

I should have used our best example: My wife had to move here suddenly in 2000 to care for her terminally ill parent and personally pay $50,000 in medical expenses plus funeral expenses for other parent.  She rented her home in KY because she was unable to return to sell. The family renting were great for years but fell on hard times & the property manager failed to report it. The property was in shambles & decreased in value from $82,000 to $35,000. My dad & I beautifully renovated the home & property costing $15,000. We sold 10/08 for $91,000 in only 3 weeks in this failing real estate market. I hope this helps further investments.  In our area there are many foreclosures at $9,000 to $39,000 and are selling quickly if renovated.
